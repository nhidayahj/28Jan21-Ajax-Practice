## movie project 

## project objectives
1. implement api endpoints to retrieve movie database
2. allow user interaction (eg. search by title, genres)
- render (displaying & hiding) list of shows based on user interaction
- using Bootstrap Modal to display more information of TV shows 
    - instead of directing to a new HTML page / URL 
    - replacing <a> tag with Button to trigger Modal
    - each Button will correspond to a different Modal by declaring each ID 

## user stories 
- enable user to search by:
    - movie titles
    - movie genres

## project practice
1. make use of open API from **https://api.tvmaze.com/** 
2. cleaning incoming useful request data
3. display random tv show each time a page refreshes - to show users that are 
a variety of tv shows / data is 'up to date'
4. ensure that data is still able to display even if certain information is not
available from the database. (in this case, even if image is not found )
